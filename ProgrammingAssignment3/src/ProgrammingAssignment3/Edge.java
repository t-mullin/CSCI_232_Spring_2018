 * Overview: This program reads in a csv file and creates a graph from an adjacency list. Algorithms will be applied on the graph to find the MST and the Transitive closure
 * Special instructions/Notes: Non-connecting edges in the file inputs must be inputted as "INF" (case-insensitive) or "âˆž" (infinity symbol).  Each input file for each algorithm's input file is named for each algorithm (prim.csv, kruskal.csv, and floyd.csv).
